# Bridge - Pi to Access point
This will turn your Pi into an access point as well as enable the ethernet port to connect to another device. This will set up the PI to act
as a DHCP server. You can specify if you want it to use same home subnet or you can use it to assing a different subent. With a different subnet
this is useful in applications like hotels that may only allow one wifi connection. However, if you are in your home, you may find advantages
to keeping it the same.
